<h1>Rapidd</h1>
<h4>What it does</h4>
 Rapidd is a ride-sharing mobile app aimed to minimize risk of carbon emissions and drunk driving. Through Rapidd, users are able to become verified as Drivers, which are those who share their rides to anyone in the area. Riders are able to get in contact with a designated Driver by picking out their destination and confirming their ride.
<h4>How we built it</h4>
The app is built using a combination of Google's Cloud Platform, along with React Native and the Google Maps API with a nodeJS backend.
<h4>Challenges</h4>
Challenges that we ran into during app development was working with Google Authentication through Google Cloud Platform, making it so users can log into the app. Understanding how to use git, as well as working with React Native presented a massive problem for us as well.
<h4> Accomplishments that we're proud of</h4>
Getting the Google Maps API to work as well as authentication was a  major breakthrough for us, and I believe that our increased efficiency and workflow as we continued to use React Native was also a plus.
<h4>What we learned</h4>
Through using Google Cloud Platform, we are able to use a multitude of tools such as Google Auth, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and CloudSQL to our advantage.
